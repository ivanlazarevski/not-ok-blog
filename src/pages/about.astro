      <p>
        Hi! My name's Ivan, but everyone calls me kid. I'm a <strong
          class="text-primary-dark">software developer</strong
        >
        with some 6-7 years of experience in enterprise IT, working in any part of
        the stack from the front-end (my current title) all the way to the database
        as a SQL developer. I also have about three years worth of experience teaching
        Web Development, focusing on Javascript technologies.

      <h2 class="text-primary-dark font-bold text-xl">What?</h2>
      <p>
        This is my personal blog, and while it will contain links towards my
        social media profiles, it won't really work as a portfolio or a page for
        proffessional inquiry. Primarly, it's a page where I focus on reviewing
        music albums, rant about gaming, films and all other sorts of
        entertainment.

      <h2 class="text-primary-dark font-bold text-xl">Why?</h2>
      <p>
        I've wanted to make a blog for a while I never really had a clear idea
        about what I wanted to write about. Ideas from tech tips to tutorials
        all came and went and I never really felt like doing any of that. And
        then I figured. Why not just talk about everything?!
